# Apollo-PW

A modern **GraphQL API testing** and **mocking framework** using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). This repository provides a foundation for testing GraphQL APIs, generating mock data, and running integration tests efficiently.

## Features

- **Apollo Server**: Easily mock and serve a GraphQL API locally.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for the different features of the API using Jest.
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests for GraphQL endpoints using Playwright.
- **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe development with robust tooling.
- **Linting and Formatting**: Ensures clean and consistent code using ESLint and Prettier.
- **GraphQL Code Generation**: Automates the creation of TypeScript types for GraphQL schemas and operations.
